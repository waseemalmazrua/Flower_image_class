# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Image Classifier

This project is a deep learning application that classifies flower images into one of 102 categories.  
It is built using PyTorch with a **fine-tuned VGG16 model**, and deployed via **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.

---

##  What does it do?

- Classifies flower images into **102 flower species** from the Flowers102 dataset.
-  Displays the **top 3 predicted flower names** along with their probabilities.
-  Accepts any JPG/PNG flower image uploaded by the user via Streamlit.

---

## Tech stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **PyTorch & torchvision** - for deep learning & transfer learning
- **Streamlit** - for building the web app
- **PIL, NumPy** - image processing
- **Flowers102 dataset** - ~8,000 images, 102 classes
